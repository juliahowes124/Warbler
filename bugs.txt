app.py - postresql connection
-'postgresql:///warbler' instead of 'postgres:///warbler'

FOR HEROKU DEPLOYMENT ADD --preload FLAG TO PROCFILE SO IT GIVES DETAILS OF ERROR
--> FOR EXAMPLE RECENT ERROR WAS THAT IT COULDN'T ACCESS ADMINPASSWORD IN UNTRACKED admin.py FILE, HAD TO SET TO HEROKU CONFIG VAR
test_user_view.py:
-bad_signup_test: had to db.session.rollback before querying for user

TODO:
-in app.py, signup- if duplicate email, should flash email already exists instead of username
-figure out how to add forms.html to edit.html if possible
-macros for forms

TODO ROUTES FOR TESTING:
-users/follows/follow_id (post)
-users/stop_following/follow_id (post)
-users/edit profile (get, post)
-deleting user account
-show individual message
-/messges/id/likes: liking messages/unliking message
-show user's likes?


CODE REVIEW THINGS WE LEARNED:
-db.session.rollback() in setUp to remove garbage data from db session 
-put with self.assertRaises(IntegrityError):
    lines that would fail in here
-split up tearDown and setUp, maybe put db.session.rollback() and remove user from db in teardown instead of setup 


-likes FK constraint failed --> if no cascade on delete when user is deleted
